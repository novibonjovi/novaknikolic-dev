          This project was an assignment from The Odin Project curriculum.
          <br />
          The goal was to create a grid of div tags as the canvas to draw lines
          on when hovering over it with the cursor. In addition to the canvas it
          should be possible to change the amount of divs on the canvas and
          change or choose the colors that are drawn by pressing buttons.<br /><br />
          The design of this project was made with the help of
          <a href="https://neumorphism.io/">neumorphism.io</a>.

        <p class="card-content">
          My goal for this project was to build a website with different charts
          to display my networth and the funds on each account. I used the local
          storage to save the user's input.
          <br /><br />
          By clicking on the the accounts on the left sidebar a prompt shows up
          and lets the user enter the month (as a number from 1-12) and the
          amount for that month.
          <br />
          The pie chart will only work if the funds for the current month are
          entered on all accounts.
          <br /><br />I used <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">charts.js</a> to
          add the charts to the website.

          This is a website with a Blackjack game playable against the

          The goal of the game is to beat the computer by having a card count of
          close to or equal to 21.<br /><br />
          This is another project I did for myself to practice javascipt. I
          found an article online which helped me with the logic of creating and
          shuffling a deck of 52 cards.

          This project was another assignment from The Odin Project curriculum.
          <br /><br />
          It's a simple Rock Paper Scissors game playable against the computer.
          The first to get five wins is declared the winner and the points are
          reset.<br /><br />
          For the design I used a grid to make it responsive for different
          screensizes.

      <p class="aboutMe">
        A couple of years ago, I began learning coding for the first time by
        following and completing Apple's tutorials for learning Swift. Even
        though I didn’t continue to learn more about app development, I was able
        to learn some basic coding concepts.
        <br /><br />
        After a few months, I decided to give coding another shot and followed
        parts of the tutorial "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”.
        <br /><br />
        This past January, I made my third attempt at learning coding. I bought
        the book "Java Head First" and found myself motivated and engaged while
        learning about object-oriented programming. The book was really
        well-written and explained programming concepts in an easily
        understandable way. When I reached the end of the book, I decided to
        focus on web development because I wanted to be able to show the things
        I learned and built to friends and family. Since March of 2020, I’ve
        been following The Odin Project curriculum and learning more about web
        development each day.
