          This project was an assignment in the odin project curriculum.<br />The
          goal was to create and display a grid of divs as the canvas to draw
          lines on when hovering over it with the cursor. In addition to the
          canvas it should be possible to change the amount of divs on the
          canvas and change or choose the colors that are drawn with buttons.<br /><br />
          The design of this project was made by myself with the help of
          <a href="https://neumorphism.io/">neumorphism.io</a>.

        <p class="card-content">
          My goal for this project was to build a website with different graphs
          to display the networth and different financial accounts by adding the
          amount for each month to the local storage of the browser.<br /><br />By
          clicking on the the accounts on the left sidebar a prompt shows up and
          lets you enter the month (as a number from 1-12) and next the amount
          for that month.<br />The pie chart will only work if the funds for the
          current month are entered.<br /><br />I used
          <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">charts.js</a> to add the charts for
          this website.

        <p class="card-content">
          This is a website with a blackjack game playable against the
          computer.<br />
          The goal of the game is to beat the computer by having a card count of
          close to or equal to 21. The player and the computer start each round
          with two cards then the player can choose to either draw more cards or
          to keep the cards. If the player has a higher count than the computer
          and less than 22 he wins, otherwise the computer wins.<br /><br />
          This is another project I did for myself to practice javascipt. I
          found an article online which helped me with the logic of creating and
          shuffling a deck of 52 cards.<br /><br />
          The blackjack game wont work on mobile because I didnt add media
          querries to the css code.

          This project was an assignment of the odin project curriculum like the
          Etch-A-Sketch website.<br /><br />
          It's a simple Rock Paper Scissors game playable against the computer.
          The player has to win 5 rounds in order to win the game. As soon as
          the player or the computer get to win 5 rounds the points will be
          reset.<br /><br />
          For the design I used a grid layout to make it responsive for
          different screensizes.

          This product landing page is an exercise from freecodecamp.<br /><br />
          The goal was to build a copy of an existing website.<br />After

          like a test to check and practice the html and css skills.

          I wrote the html and the css code to create a page as close as

          This exercise was about learning to use the developer tools of the
          chrome browser and imitate the google homepage just with html and css.

      <p>
        A couple of years ago I tried to learn coding for the first time by
        following and completeting apple's tutorials for learning swift.<br />
        Even though I didnt continue to learn more about app develpment I was
        able to learn the basic concepts of coding.<br /><br />
        After some months I wanted to try it again and decided to give python a
        shot. I followed the turorial "automate the boring stuff with python".
        Unfortuately I didnt stay motivated enough to finish this book.<br /><br />
        This year in january was my 3rd attempt to learn coding. I bought the
        book "Java Head First" and I had a lot of fun and motivation while
        learning a lot about object oriented programming. This book is really
        well writeen and explains all the concepts in an understandable way. By
        the time I reached the end of this book I decided to switch to web
        development because I wanted to be able to show the things I learned and
        built to friends and family. Web Development was perfect to learn, build
        and show the websites I create to other people. Since around march im
        consistantly learning more about web development by mainly follwoing the
        odin project curriculum.
