          This project was an assignment in "the odin project".<br />The goal
          was to create and display a grid of divs as the canvas to draw lines
          on when hovering over it with the cursor. In addition to the canvas it
          should be possible to change the amount of "pixels" on the canvas and
          change or choose the colors that are drawn with buttons.<br /><br />This
          project involved the use of DOM-manipulation and javascript to code
          the canvas and the buttons.<br />The design of this project was made
          by myself with the help of
          <a href="https://neumorphism.io/">neumorphism.io</a>.

        <p class="card-content">
          My goal for this project was to build a website with different graphs
          to display the networth and different financial accounts by adding the
          amount for each month to the local storage of the browser.<br /><br />By
          clicking on the the accounts on the left sidebar a prompt shows up and
          lets you enter the month (as a number from 1-12) and next the amount
          for that month.<br />The pie chart will only work if the funds for the
          current month are entered.<br /><br />I used
          <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Charts.js</a> to add the charts for
          this website.

        <p class="card-content">
          This is a website with a blackjack game playable against the
          computer.<br />
          The goal of the game is to beat the computer by having a card count of
          close to or equal to 21. The player and the computer start each round
          with two cards then the player can choose to either draw more cards or
          to keep the cards. If the player has a higher count than the computer
          and less than 22 he wins, otherwise the computer wins.<br /><br />
          This is another project I did for mysefl to practice javascipt. I
          found an article online which helped me with the logic of creating and
          shuffling a deck of 52 cards.<br /><br />
          The blackjack game wont work and look good on mobile because I didnt
          add any media querries to the css code.

        <p class="card-content">
          This project was an assignment of the odin project like the
          Etch-A-Sketch website.<br /><br />
          It's a simple rock-paper-scissors game playable against the compute.
          The player has to win 5 rounds in order to win the game. As soon as
          the player or the computer get to win 5 rounds the points will be
          reset.<br /><br />
          Fot the design i used a grid layout to make it responsive for
          different screensizes.<br />
          I also added an animation when hovering over the three choices at the
          bottom.

          This product landing page is an exercise from freecodecamp.<br /><br />
          The goal was to build a copy an existing website by inspecting it in
          the browser.<br />After completing some lessons on html and css this
          product landing page was like a test to check and practice the html
          and css skills.

          By inspecting an existing page I coded the layout and the css to
          created this page as close as possible to the existing one.

          I made this website also by inspecting the original google homepage
          and tried to code a copy of it that will look as close to the original
          as possible.<br /><br />
          This exercise was about learning to use the developer tools of the
          chrome browser and imitate an existing website just with html and css.

      <p>
        A couple of years ago I tried to learn coding fo the first time by
        following and completeting apple's tutorials for learning swift.<br />
        Even though I didnt continue to learn more about app develpment I was
        able to learn basic concepts of coding.<br /><br />
        After some month I wanted to try it again and afte some research I
        decided to give python a shot. I followed the turorial "automate the
        boring stuff with python". Unfortuately I didnt stay motivated enough to
        finish this book and keep learning more about python.<br /><br />
        This year in january was my 3rd attempt to learn coding. I bought the
        book "Java Head First" and I had a lot of fun and motivation while
        learning a lot about object oriented programming. This book is really
        well writeen and explains all the concepts in an understandable way. By
        the time I reached the end of this book I decided to switch to web
        development because i wanted to learn something and be able to show it
        to friends and family. Web Development was perfect to learn, build and
        show the websites i create to other people. Since around march im
        consistantly learning more about web development by follwoing mainly the
        odin project.
